# RefactoringiOS7cookBook
iOS7CookBookChap1

following the format provided by the original cookbook i'm working thru all the exercises presented and refactoring code where necessary.
This will be an ongoing project to sharpen my coding skills.  Everyone is welcome to work on sample code provided, or slack the repo and work on their own copy.
If you get stuck working on any of this materia post your question(s) to http://www.meetup.com/methodologies/
